# Performance-Student-Stressulator
Fun little Max/MSP patch to emulate the effects of stress on a performance student (MIDI) playing some Mozart. *Note: Max/MSP is a visual coding language, and as such the textual representation provided by Github is incomprehensible. Please download any .maxpat files and open them in Max/MSP*
